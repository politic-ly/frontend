# Welcome to Politic.ly!
This project aims to bring an average American community closer and help create impact within their local environment. While national politics and policies are important, they get plenty of platforms to communicate with citizens. However, local politics rarely get the same level of attention. Through this app, we want to make local politics accessible, especially to young adults who are the most motivated to bring about change. We want to allow local citizens to create initiatives, gather support, and take action to make their communities better.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to simply traverse our application, you can visit our live site at [](politicly.app). You'll need to use your Google account to login. Once you've logged into, you'll be brought to the Home page. 

![Home Page]()

From the Home Page, you can explore initiatives happening in your area or see upcoming events to volunteer with using the tab icons to toggle content. Initiative Cards are a preview that includes the title, short description, location, and volunteer count. You can favorite initiatives you're interested by toggling the heart icon. If you look at the Navigation bar at the top, you can click on any of the icons and they'll take you to new pages. The Heart icon will take you to the favorites page where users can see initiatives they've favorited or saved for later. The Compass icon will take users to the Explore page. Initiatives specific to the user's interests will populate here. The Bell Icon will open the Announcements popover. Any updates or announcements from favorited initiatives will appear here. The Newspaper icon will take users to the News page. Here, users can read articles published by local papers to stay updated on their community. The Account page will open a dropdown prompting users to either go to their Account page or logout. And finally, our logo in the top lefthand corner will return users to the Home page.
